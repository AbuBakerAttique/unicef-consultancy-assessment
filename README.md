Folder & File Descriptions
data/
Holds all the raw source files needed for the analysis. You should not modify these:

WPP2022_GEN_F01_DEMOGRAPHIC_INDICATORS_COMPACT_REV1.xlsx – UN WPP population projections

On-track and off-track countries.xlsx – U5MR status classifications

ANC4_long.xlsx & SBA_long.xlsx – Coverage data for ANC4 and SBA, in long format

UNICEF_Assessment.ipynb – A self‑contained Jupyter/Colab notebook that loads data, performs cleaning, computes population‑weighted coverage, generates visualizations, and includes the interpretation write‑up.

outputs/
Stores the generated report files and any exported figures:

report.html – Complete analysis rendered as an HTML report

Data Sources
Population Projections (2022)
UN World Population Prospects 2022 (Medium variant, Projections sheet)

Under‑5 Mortality Classification
On‑track vs. Off‑track countries (Status.U5MR)

ANC4 & SBA Coverage (2018–2022)
UNICEF Global Data Repository (long‑format Excel)

Assumptions & Notes
Birth projections: Used 2022 medium‑variant births from the “Projections” sheet.

Coverage years: Filtered ANC4/SBA to 2018–2022 and kept only the most recent value per country.

Group definitions:

On‑track = Status.U5MR “achieved” or “on‑track”
Off‑track = Status.U5MR “acceleration needed”

Data matching: Country names/ISO3 codes were used to merge datasets. A few small territories may be omitted if identifiers did not align exactly.

📊 Key Results
Service	On‑track (%)	Off‑track (%)
ANC4	46.7	49.9
SBA	60.3	67.5
